# Reddit Comment Collapser

Reddit Comment Collapser is a more elegant solution for collapsing reddit comment trees.

Collapse a comment and all of it's replies by clicking on the column of the comment you wish to collapse.

No longer get stuck in the middle of a huge comment chain - simply select the outermost column to collapse the whole top-level-comment.
